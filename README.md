# plugin.program.chrome.launcher

This is my first repository. I decided to take on MODDING plugins for Kodi and this is my first project. In this MOD I have added the ability to save custom thumbnails to the plugin folder then they can be used with Chrome Launcher and Kodi will display your thumbs as fanart.
