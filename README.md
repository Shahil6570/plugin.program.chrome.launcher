# plugin.program.chrome.launcher

This is my first repository. I decided to take on MODDING plugins for Kodi and this is my first project. In this MOD I have added the ability to save custom thumbnails to the plugin folder then they can be used with Chrome Launcher and Kodi will display your thumbs as fanart.

# Notes

This is a work in progress, it may not work as expected or it may not work at all. I am using this MOD to learn some basics of KODI coding. I wanted to be able to use Fanart for the Chrome Launcher links so I modded it to do that and I was getting a lot of errors with the last plugin I tried that used proxy settings so I took the proxy stuff out.
